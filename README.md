# APA-Custom-LaTeX-Template
This is a LaTeX template designed for the APA referencing style but with numeric in-text citations. Some academic journals require this specific citation format, and this template provides a ready-to-use solution. The template includes an algorithm for extracting and configuring citation data in BibLaTeX format. For example, in some cases, the booktitle field of a proceedings paper entry may contain all information from conference title, location, and date. The algorithm can extract these information and configure them according to the referencing style required (if modlfied).
